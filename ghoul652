The available virtual machine types are:

ubuntu-latest, ubuntu-18.04, or ubuntu-16.04
windows-latest or windows-2019
macos-latest or macos-10.15
For more information, see "Virtual environments for GitHub Actions."

Using an action
Actions are reusable units of code that can be built and distributed by anyone on GitHub. You can find a variety of actions in GitHub Marketplace, and also in the official Actions repository.

To use an action, you must specify the repository that contains the action. We also recommend that you specify a Git tag to ensure you are using a released version of the action.

- name: Setup Node
  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: '10.x'
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running a command
You can run commands on the job's virtual machine.

- name: Install Dependencies
  run: npm install
For more information, see "Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions."

Running a job across a matrix of operating systems and runtime versions
You can automatically run a job across a set of different values, such as different versions of code libraries or operating systems.

For example, this job uses a matrix strategy to run across 3 versions of Node and 3 operating systems:

jobs:
  test:
    name: Test on node ${{ matrix.node_version }} and ${{ matrix.os }}
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node_version: ['8', '10', '12']
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macOS-latest]

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v1
    - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node_version }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node_version }}

    - name: npm install, build and test
      run: |
        npm install
        npm run build --if-present
        npm test
